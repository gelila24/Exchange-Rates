# Hello and welcome to my React typescript Exchange Rate Application

## Notes: 
*  I used the free subscription of [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/), so it might have expired when you clone this project.
   If that happens subscribe to their page and get a free API key. 
   
   After getting your API key go to the state folder in scr open the constants folder then index.ts and replace
   the const "apikey" with the new one.
   
   
## Description

Exchange Rate Application is a simple two page application that converts currency is one and shows the current exchange rates against the base 
currency on the other. This application has a navigation bar to switching between pages, also uses Redux as a state manager, lazy loading and 
code splitting to make the performance of the application faster.
